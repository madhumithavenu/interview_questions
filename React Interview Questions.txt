1) What is Single Page Application ?
Single page applications work within a single browser session and allow users to jump between parts of the system without requiring the entire page to reload.

2) Difference between npm & npx ?
• Node package Manager is a tool: used to install, maintain, uninstall javascript modules (packages)
• NPX: (Node package Execution) If we want directly run a package for once.
• NPM is for management -vs- NPX is one time execution.

3) What is babel & Web-pack?
• Bable is a transpiler & also a compiler.
• It will take ES6 input & converts it to ES5 for our browsers to understand.
• It also converts JSX (JavaScript Extended) language to JS.
• Web-pack is basically bundling tool used by react:
• It will bundle all the CSS & html files & will add to Index.html file. (Using <link> tags)

4) Explain Class based components vs functional components?
Functional Components
* Functional components are written as a JavaScript function.
* Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods.
* Faster performance as they do not have state and lifecycle, react needs to do less work to render these components.
* Functional components code  tend to be shorter and more concise.
Class Components
* Class components are written as a JavaScript class.
* Class components have a state and can implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
* Slower performance as they have state and lifecycle, react needs to do comparatively more work to render these components.
* Class components require the boilerplate code, such as a constructor method and the use of “this” to access props and state.

5) What is Hooks? What are different types of Hooks?
  Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
Types of Hooks are:
•‘useState’: It is the most commonly used React Hook. It allows functional components to have state variables. It takes an initial state value as the argument and returns an array with two elements — the current state value and a function to update that state.
•‘useEffect’: It enables performing side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations after the component has been rendered.
•‘useRef’: Provides a way to create mutable references to values or DOM elements that persist across renders. Often used for accessing or manipulating DOM elements.

6) What is a state in React?
State is an Object, and we use the state to store data, that will be used by our component.A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
