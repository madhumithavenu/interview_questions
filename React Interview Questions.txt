1) What is Single Page Application ?
Single page applications work within a single browser session and allow users to jump between parts of the system without requiring the entire page to reload.

2) Difference between npm & npx ?
• Node package Manager is a tool: used to install, maintain, uninstall javascript modules (packages)
• NPX: (Node package Execution) If we want directly run a package for once.
• NPM is for management -vs- NPX is one time execution.

3) What is babel & Web-pack?
• Bable is a transpiler & also a compiler.
• It will take ES6 input & converts it to ES5 for our browsers to understand.
• It also converts JSX (JavaScript Extended) language to JS.
• Web-pack is basically bundling tool used by react:
• It will bundle all the CSS & html files & will add to Index.html file. (Using <link> tags)

4) Explain Class based components vs functional components?
Functional Components
* Functional components are written as a JavaScript function.
* Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods.
* Faster performance as they do not have state and lifecycle, react needs to do less work to render these components.
* Functional components code  tend to be shorter and more concise.
Class Components
* Class components are written as a JavaScript class.
* Class components have a state and can implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
* Slower performance as they have state and lifecycle, react needs to do comparatively more work to render these components.
* Class components require the boilerplate code, such as a constructor method and the use of “this” to access props and state.

6) What is a state in React?
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
