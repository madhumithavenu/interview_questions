SQL Query Questions

	);

2) Create a table with a single field as Unique.
CREATE TABLE Students (  
	   ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
	   Name VARCHAR(255)
	);

3) Create a table with a single field as Foreign key.
CREATE TABLE Students (  
	   ID INT NOT NULL
	   Name VARCHAR(255)
	   LibraryID INT
	   PRIMARY KEY (ID)

4) What are the different types of joins?
There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:
=> (INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.
Example: ->SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	JOIN Table_B;
	->SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	INNER JOIN Table_B;
=> LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.
Example:SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	LEFT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
=> RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.
Example: SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
=> FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.
Example: SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	FULL JOIN Table_B B
ON A.col = B.col;
