1) What is Database?
A) A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches.

2) What is DBMS?
A) DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end-users or application software.

3) What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
A) RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

4) What is SQL?
A) SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.

5) What is a Primary Key?
A) The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.
A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).
Example:
CREATE TABLE Students (   /* Create table with a single field as primary key */
   ID INT NOT NULL
   Name VARCHAR(255)
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

6) What is a UNIQUE constraint?
A) A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite similar to that of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably.
Example: 
CREATE TABLE Students (   /* Create table with a single field as unique */
   ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
   Name VARCHAR(255)
);

7) What is a Foreign Key?
A) A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.
The table with the foreign key constraint is labeled as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is labeled as the referenced or parent table.
Example: 
CREATE TABLE Students (   /* Create table with foreign key - Way 1 */
   ID INT NOT NULL
   Name VARCHAR(255)
   LibraryID INT
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
   FOREIGN KEY (Library_ID) REFERENCES Library(LibraryID)
);

8) What is a Join? List its different types.
A) The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two.
There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:
=> (INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.
Example: ->SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	JOIN Table_B;
	->SELECT *
	FROM Table_A
	INNER JOIN Table_B;
=> LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.
Example:SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	LEFT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
=> RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.
Example: SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;
=> FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.
Example: SELECT *
	FROM Table_A A
	FULL JOIN Table_B B
	ON A.col = B.col;

9) What is a Cross-Join?
A) Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables included in the join. The table after join contains the same number of rows as in the cross-product of the number of rows in the two tables. If a WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.
Example: SELECT stu.name, sub.subject 
	FROM students AS stu
	CROSS JOIN subjects AS sub;

10) What are the different subsets of SQL?
A) -> Data Definition Language (DDL) – It allows you to perform various operations on the database such as CREATE, ALTER, and DELETE objects.
-> Data Manipulation Language(DML) – It allows you to access and manipulate data. It helps you to insert, update, delete and retrieve data from the database.
-> Data Control Language(DCL) – It allows you to control access to the database. Example – Grant, Revoke access permissions.

11. What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?
A) The following are some frequent SQL clauses used in conjunction with a SELECT query:
-> WHERE clause: In SQL, the WHERE clause is used to filter records that are required depending on certain criteria.
-> ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order depending on specified field(s) (DESC).
Example: SELECT *
	FROM myDB.students
	WHERE graduation_year = 2019
	ORDER BY studentID DESC;
-> GROUP BY clause: GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group entries with identical data and may be used with aggregation methods to obtain summarised database results.
-> HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause. It is different from WHERE, since the WHERE clause cannot filter aggregated records.
Example:  SELECT COUNT(studentId), country
	FROM myDB.students
	WHERE country != "INDIA"
	GROUP BY country
	HAVING COUNT(studentID) > 5;

12) What is Cursor? How to use a Cursor?
A) After any variable declaration, DECLARE a cursor. A SELECT Statement must always be coupled with the cursor definition.
To start the result set, move the cursor over it. Before obtaining rows from the result set, the OPEN statement must be executed.
To retrieve and go to the next row in the result set, use the FETCH command.
To disable the cursor, use the CLOSE command.
Finally, use the DEALLOCATE command to remove the cursor definition and free up the resources connected with it.

13) List the different types of relationships in SQL.
A) There are different types of relations in the database:
-> One-to-One – This is a connection between two tables in which each record in one table corresponds to the maximum of one record in the other.
-> One-to-Many and Many-to-One – This is the most frequent connection, in which a record in one table is linked to several records in another.
-> Many-to-Many – This is used when defining a relationship that requires several instances on each sides.

14) What is the difference between the database and the table?
A) There is a major difference between a database and a table. The differences are as follows:
Tables are a way to represent the division of data in a database while the database is a collection of tables and data.
Tables are used to group the data in relation to each other and create a dataset. This dataset will be used in the database. The data stored in the table in any form is a part of the database, but the reverse is not true.
A database is a collection of organized data and features used to access them, whereas the table is a collection of rows and columns used to store the data.

15) What is a View?
A) A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

16) What is the difference between DROP and TRUNCATE statements?
A) If a table is dropped, all things associated with the tables are dropped as well. This includes - the relationships defined on the table with other tables, the integrity checks and constraints, access privileges and other grants that the table has. To create and use the table again in its original form, all these relations, checks, constraints, privileges and relationships need to be redefined. However, if a table is truncated, none of the above problems exist and the table retains its original structure.

17) What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements?
A) The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
The DELETE command deletes only the rows from the table based on the condition given in the where clause or deletes all the rows from the table if no condition is specified. But it does not free the space containing the table.

18) What is a clause?
A) A condition imposed on a SQL query to filter the data to obtain the desired result. Some examples are WHERE, LIMIT, HAVING, LIKE, AND, OR, ORDER BY, etc.

19) What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
A) CHAR and VARCHAR have differed in storage and retrieval.
CHAR column length is fixed, while VARCHAR length is variable.
The maximum no. of character CHAR data types can hold is 255 characters, while VARCHAR can hold up to 4000 characters.
CHAR is 50% faster than VARCHAR.
CHAR uses static memory allocation, while VARCHAR uses dynamic memory allocation

20) What is the difference between NOW() and CURRENT_DATE()?
A) NOW() command is used to show current year, month, date with hours, minutes, and seconds while CURRENT_DATE() shows the current year with month and date only.

21) How to change the MySQL password?
A) We can change the MySQL root password using the below statement in the new notepad file and save it with an appropriate name:
Example:   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NewPassword';

22) What do you mean by % and _ in the LIKE statement?
A) % corresponds to 0 or more characters, _ is exactly one character in the LIKE statement.

23) How does DISTINCT work in MySQL?
A) DISTINCT is used to avoid the problem of duplicity while fetching the results of a particular query. DISTINCT is used to make sure the results do not contain repeated values. DISTINCT can be used with the SELECT clause. Here is the syntax for it:
Example: SELECT DISTINCT something FROM tablename;

24) What is NULL value? How is it different from zero or a blank space?
A) A NULL value indicates the absence of data for a certain cell of a table. Instead, zero is a valid numeric value, and an empty string is a legal string of zero length.

25) What is the SELECT statement?
A) A SELECT command gets zero or more rows from one or more database tables or views. The most frequent data manipulation language (DML) command is SELECT in most applications. SELECT queries define a result set, but not how to calculate it, because SQL is a declarative programming language.
Query: SELECT * FROM myDB.students;

26) What are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?
A) Some common SQL clauses used in conjuction with a SELECT query are as follows:
-> WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records that are necessary, based on specific conditions.
-> ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the records based on some field(s) in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC).
Query: SELECT *
	FROM myDB.students
	WHERE graduation_year = 2019
	ORDER BY studentID DESC;
-> GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group records with identical data and can be used in conjunction with some aggregation functions to produce summarized results from the database.
-> HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause. It is different from WHERE, since the WHERE clause cannot filter aggregated records.
Query: SELECT COUNT(studentId), country
	FROM myDB.students
	WHERE country != "INDIA"
	GROUP BY country
	HAVING COUNT(studentID) > 5;

27) What is Pattern Matching in SQL?
A) SQL pattern matching provides for pattern search in data if you have no clue as to what that word should be. This kind of SQL query uses wildcards to match a string pattern, rather than writing the exact word. The LIKE operator is used in conjunction with SQL Wildcards to fetch the required information.
Using the % wildcard to perform a simple search
The % wildcard matches zero or more characters of any type and can be used to define wildcards both before and after the pattern. Search a student in your database with first name beginning with the letter K:
Query: SELECT *
	FROM students
	WHERE first_name LIKE 'K%'

28) What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators in SQL? 
 A) -> BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator is used to fetch rows based on a range of values. 
Query: SELECT * FROM Students 
	WHERE ROLL_NO BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
This query will select all those rows from the table. Students where the value of the field ROLL_NO lies between 20 and 30. 
-> IN : The IN operator is used to check for values contained in specific sets. 
Query: SELECT * FROM Students 
	WHERE ROLL_NO IN (20,21,23);
This query will select all those rows from the table Students where the value of the field ROLL_NO is either 20 or 21 or 23.

29) What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
A) -> Primary Key	
The primary key act as a unique identifier for each record in the table.	
We cannot store NULL values in the primary key column.
We cannot change or delete the primary key column values.
-> Unique Key
The unique key is also a unique identifier for records when the primary key is not present in the table.
We can store NULL value in the unique key column, but only one NULL is allowed.
We can modify the unique key column values.

30) What is the ACID property in a database?
A) The ACID properties are meant for the transaction that goes through a different group of tasks. A transaction is a single logical order of data. It provides properties to maintain consistency before and after the transaction in a database. It also ensures that the data transactions are processed reliably in a database system.
The ACID property is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- Atomicity: It ensures that all statements or operations within the transaction unit must be executed successfully. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. Its main features are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and AUTO-COMMIT.
- Consistency: This property ensures that the data must meet all validation rules. In simple words, we can say that the database changes state only when a transaction will be committed successfully. It also protects data from crashes.
- Isolation: This property guarantees that the concurrent property of execution in the transaction unit must be operated independently. It also ensures that statements are transparent to each other. The main goal of providing isolation is to control concurrency in a database.
- Durability: This property guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it persists permanently even if the system crashes, power loss, or failed.

31) How to create a table in SQL?
A) The command to create a table in SQL is extremely simple:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column1 datatype,
	column2 datatype,
	column3 datatype,
   ....
);
Query: CREATE TABLE employee (
	name varchar(25),
	age int,
	gender varchar(25)
);

32) How to delete a table in SQL?
A) There are two ways to delete a table from SQL: DROP and TRUNCATE. The DROP TABLE command is used to completely delete the table from the database. This is the command:
	DROP TABLE table_name;

33) How to change a table name in SQL?
A) This is the command to change a table name in SQL:
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	RENAME TO new_table_name;
Query: ALTER TABLE employee
 	RENAME TO employee_information;

34) How to delete a row in SQL?
We will be using the DELETE query to delete existing rows from the table:
	DELETE FROM table_name
	WHERE [condition];
Query: DELETE FROM employee
	WHERE [age=25];

35) How to create a database in SQL?
A) A database is a repository in SQL, which can comprise multiple tables.
This will be the command to create a database in sql:
	CREATE DATABASE database_name.

36) How do I view tables in SQL?
A) To view tables in SQL, all you need to do is give this command:
	Show tables;

37) What is the update command in SQL?
A) The update command comes under the DML(Data Manipulation Langauge) part of sql and is used to update the existing data in the table.
Query: UPDATE employees
	SET last_name=‘Cohen’
	WHERE employee_id=101;
With this update command, I am changing the last name of the employee.

38) Write a Query to display the number of employees working in each region? 
A) SELECT region, COUNT(gender) FROM employee GROUP BY region;

39) Write SQL query to fetch employee names having a salary greater than or equal to 20000 and less than or equal 10000.

Query: SELECT FullName FROM EmployeeDetails WHERE EmpId IN (SELECT EmpId FROM EmployeeSalary WHERE Salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000)

40) How to delete a column in SQL?
A) To delete a column in SQL we will be using DROP COLUMN method:
Query:      ALTER TABLE employees
	DROP COLUMN age;

41) How to implement multiple conditions using the WHERE clause?
A) We can implement multiple conditions using AND, OR operators:
Query:  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = ‘Steven’ AND salary <=10000;

42) How to add a new column in SQL?
A) We can add a new column in SQL with the help of alter command:
Query:   ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN contact INT(10);

43) How do we avoid getting duplicate entries in a query?
A) The SELECT DISTINCT is used to get distinct data from tables using a query. The below SQL query selects only the DISTINCT values from the “Country” column in the “Customers” table:
Query:     SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

44) What is the stored procedure in SQL Server?
A) A Stored Procedure is nothing but a frequently used SQL query. Queries such as a SELECT query, which would often be used to retrieve a set of information many times within a database, can be saved as a Stored Procedure. The Stored Procedure, when called, executes the SQL query saved within the Stored Procedure.
Syntax to create a Stored Proc:
	CREATE PROCEDURE PROCEDURE_NAME
	AS
	SQL_QUERY (GIVE YOUR OFTEN USED QUERY HERE)
	GO;

45) What are the different types of SQL operators?
A) Operators are the special keywords or special characters reserved for performing particular operations. They are also used in SQL queries. We can primarily use these operators within the WHERE clause of SQL commands. It's a part of the command to filters data based on the specified condition. The SQL operators can be categorized into the following types:
-> Arithmetic operators: These operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical data. The categories of this operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), remainder/modulus (%), etc.
-> Logical operators: These operators evaluate the expressions and return their results in True or False. This operator includes ALL, AND, ANY, ISNULL, EXISTS, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, NOT, OR, UNIQUE.
-> Comparison operators: These operators are used to perform comparisons of two values and check whether they are the same or not. It includes equal to (=), not equal to (!= or <>), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), not less than (!<), not greater than (!>), etc.
-> Bitwise operators: It is used to do bit manipulations between two expressions of integer type. It first performs conversion of integers into binary bits and then applied operators such as AND (& symbol), OR (|, ^), NOT (~), etc.
-> Compound operators: These operators perform operations on a variable before setting the variable's result to the operation's result. It includes Add equals (+=), subtract equals (-=), multiply equals (*=), divide equals (/=), modulo equals (%=), etc.
-> String operators: These operators are primarily used to perform concatenation and pattern matching of strings. It includes + (String concatenation), += (String concatenation assignment), % (Wildcard), [] (Character(s) matches), [^] (Character(s) not to match), _ (Wildcard match one character), etc.

46) What are Aggregate functions?
A) An aggregate function performs operations on a collection of values to return a single scalar value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement. Following are the widely used SQL aggregate functions:
-> AVG() - Calculates the mean of a collection of values.
-> COUNT() - Counts the total number of records in a specific table or view.
-> MIN() - Calculates the minimum of a collection of values.
-> MAX() - Calculates the maximum of a collection of values.
-> SUM() - Calculates the sum of a collection of values.
-> FIRST() - Fetches the first element in a collection of values.
-> LAST() - Fetches the last element in a collection of values.
Note: All aggregate functions described above ignore NULL values except for the COUNT function.

47) Write a query to get the current date.
A) Query:  SELECT GETDATE();

48) Write a query to create a new table which consists of data and structure copied from the other table.
A) Using the SELECT INTO command:
Query:   SELECT * INTO NewTable FROM EmployeeTable WHERE 1 = 0;
Using the CREATE command in MySQL:
Query:  CREATE TABLE NewTable AS SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo;

49) Write a query to fetch top N records.
A) By using the TOP command in SQL Server:
Query:  SELECT TOP N * FROM EmployeePosition ORDER BY Salary DESC;
By using the LIMIT command in MySQL:
Query:  SELECT * FROM EmpPosition ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT N;

50) What are Constraints in SQL?
A) Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or after creating using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:
NOT NULL- Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

60) Write an SQL query to fetch common records between two tables.
A) SQL Server – Using INTERSECT operator-
Query:      SELECT * FROM EmployeeSalary
	INTERSECT
	SELECT * FROM ManagerSalary;

	WHERE YEAR(DateOfJoining) = '2020';

66) Write an SQL query to remove duplicates from a table without using a temporary table.
A) Here, we can use delete with alias and inner join. We will check for the equality of all the matching records and then remove the row with a higher EmpId.
Query:      DELETE E1 FROM EmployeeDetails E1
	INNER JOIN EmployeeDetails E2 
	WHERE E1.EmpId > E2.EmpId 
	AND E1.FullName = E2.FullName

	AND E1.DateOfJoining = E2.DateOfJoining
	AND E1.City = E2.City;

67. Write an SQL query to fetch only odd rows from the table.
A) In case we have an auto-increment field e.g. EmpId then we can simply use the below query-
Query:	SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails 
	WHERE MOD (EmpId, 2) <> 0;
In case we don’t have such a field then we can use the below queries.
Using Row_number in SQL server and checking that the remainder when divided by 2 is 1-
Query:      SELECT E.EmpId, E.Project, E.Salary
	FROM (
	    SELECT *, Row_Number() OVER(ORDER BY EmpId) AS RowNumber
	    FROM EmployeeSalary
	) E
	WHERE E.RowNumber % 2 = 1;
Using a user-defined variable in MySQL-
Query: SELECT *
	FROM (
	      SELECT *, @rowNumber := @rowNumber+ 1 rn
	      FROM EmployeeSalary
	      JOIN (SELECT @rowNumber:= 0) r
	     ) t

	FROM (
	      SELECT DISTINCT TOP N Salary
	      FROM Employee
	      ORDER BY Salary DESC
	      )
	ORDER BY Salary ASC;
Using limit clause(MySQL)-
Query: 	SELECT Salary
	FROM Employee
	ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT N-1,1;
